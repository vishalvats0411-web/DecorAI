## üåü Overview

Redecorating a room often starts with a fresh coat of paint, but choosing the right color can be an overwhelming and costly decision. DECORAI solves this problem by providing a robust system that allows homeowners to see how their rooms would look before ever picking up a paintbrush.

The application uses advanced deep learning techniques, including Meta AI's **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**, to automatically detect walls while intelligently ignoring complex objects like furniture and decor. Users can instantly apply new colors, explore AI-generated recommendations, and even experiment with different textures to find the perfect look for their space.
